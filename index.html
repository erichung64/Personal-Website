        Hi there! I'm Justina, a senior at Vernon Hills High School. I founded <a href="https://haxorg.io/">HAX</a>, a student-run non-profit that aims to make computer science more accessible, one hackathon at a time. Last summer, I interned at <a href="https://statefarm.com/">State Farm's</a> headquarters, developing on Statefarm.com.  <br> <br> 

        I am a fierce advocate for equitable computer science education and bridging the gender gap in the tech industry. I'm actively involved in all-female and non-binary communities as a 
        <a href="http://www.sheplusplus.com/include">Stanford She++</a> Fellow,  
        <a href="https://gotechnica.org/">Technica</a> Winner, 
        <a href="https://justina.me/https//girlconchicago.com">GirlCon</a> Organizer, 
        <a href="https://www.aspirations.org/user/129470">NCWIT</a> Awardee, 
        <a href="https://www.builtbygirls.com/about-wave">BUILT BY GIRLS</a> Advisee, and 
        <a href="https://boston.techtogether.io/">Tech Together Boston</a>  Ambassador. 
        
        <br> <br> I intend to pursue computer science in college to leverage technology for social good, whether that be through inclusive design, sustainability efforts, or anything in between. I value authenticity, simplicity, and empathy.
        
        <br> <br> When I'm not working on projects, you can find me listening to bops on Spotify or going on boba runs.
